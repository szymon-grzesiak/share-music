### Project Reflection & Key Learnings

This project was a significant learning experience, particularly in understanding framework architecture and its impact on user experience.

While I truly enjoyed the development process with Laravel and its robust backend capabilities, I encountered a core challenge related to its traditional, server-side routing. The full-page re-rendering on each route change caused the music player to reset, which disrupts the continuous listening experience.

This was a practical demonstration of why a Single Page Application (SPA) framework (like React/Vue) or a hybrid solution (like Laravel with Inertia.js/Livewire) is better suited for building such highly interactive UIs. It was an invaluable lesson in choosing the right tool for the specific job.
